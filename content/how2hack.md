# How To Hack 2025

This document describes the concept for science teams and communication by those who you cannot just walk over and talk to! The first stop on the hackathon journey are your fellow hackers in the same room: find out what they are working on, offer to help and share. 

The following discussion of teams and tools is intended to be used within a node and especially across nodes. We discuss below this organization:
- Science Teams
- Instant Messaging/Chat (Mattermost)
- Code/Script/Tool Sharing and Asynchronous Discussions (Github)
- Live video calls (Zoom)

## Science Team Organization

We want to connect people working on different science topics. The primary unit of organization across nodes will be ‘science teams’ which are user proposed. The current list of science teams and topics is described on a [Science Teams webpage](https://digital-earths-global-hackathon.github.io/hk25/scienceteams/) on the hackathon website. 

The science teams will communicate in the following ways:

- Each science team will have a mattermost channel `hk25-<name>` (e.g. `hk25-MCS`). 

- Science Teams will have a zoom breakout room (see above)
Zoom calls can be arranged via mattermost. 

- The primary means of communication will be sharing code and discussions (via github issues) on the [github science teams repository](https://github.com/digital-earths-global-hackathon/hk25-teams)
    - For more on github, see specific github section below

- To start or join a discussion on a science topic, use github ‘issues’ in the `hk25-teams` repository

    - See this [github issues quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/configuring-issues/quickstart) tutorial for working with issues on Github. Mostly you will just want to filter issues by label for the science team (e.g. `hk25-MCS`), and you can add comments, figures. 


    - Make sure your issue has a label corresponding to the science team (e.g. hk25-MCS). See [managing github labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels) for more information.

- To share code or scripts, you can push them up to the github repository for each team. Contact the team lead or a local contact who knows about github if you are not experienced doing this. Downloading scripts from github is a simple click.  

If you want to join a science team: 

- Join the mattermost channel for the team (see Mattermost): You can search for the channel and join it
    - Find channels in mattermost using "Find Channel" and search on hk25-[TeamName], and just click on it to join

-  Email the organizer (see the website above or github README pages for each team)

If you do not see a science team of interest:

- We encourage you to see if there is a team which is already related and join it

- If not, create your own! See the instructions (README) in the (hackathon science teams repository)[https://github.com/digital-earths-global-hackathon/hk25-teams]. It would help to have some knowledge of github, or team up with someone who does. 

## Mattermost

Mattermost will serve as the instant messenger service across nodes (and within nodes). One can easily start written conversations across nodes, open public and private channels to discuss certain topics. We will use the [WCRP Lighthouse mattermost team](https://mattermost.mpimet.mpg.de/signup_user_complete/?id=w9ara4zws7gktd9waxxdz4wyjr&md=link&sbr=su). All participants will receive an invite to join the service. 

Mattermost works like slack or other instant messaging clients, either through a web browser or dedicated app on a computer or mobile device. We recommend the desktop app.

Mattermost is organized into ‘channels’. The hackathon channels for participants will all have `hk-` in the beginning of them. You can find channels in the upper left search box (start with `hk25-`). 

Channels are organized as follows: 
- All hackathon channels should start with `hk25-`
- Individual nodes can create their own internal channels with another descriptor, e.g. `hk25-UK`
- There are 2 general channels
    - Broadcasting general information: (`kk25-Global Commons`) 
    - A channel for data questions (`hk25-Data-Model Questions`)
- Each Science Team (see below) will have a channel with its name (e.g. `hk25-MCS)` for communication

## Github

Most of our technical communication will happen by [github](http://github.com/). Github is a git repository site which is designed to hold documents with information, code and provide a platform for discussions on ‘issues’. 

If you are not familiar with github and git for version control, start with some introductory [github skills](https://skills.github.com/) tutorials. We will be using github issues, and documents in markdown format, as well as sharing code by pushing code up to repositories (mostly for the science teams).

Downloading notebooks is simple, if you want to contribute and are not familiar with git, ask someone, or send files to a science team lead or github expert (we are hoping each node will have one). 

Ways we will interact on github:
- Start at the [github hackathon overview page](https://github.com/digital-earths-global-hackathon/) and look at ‘repositories’ tab
- Useful repositories for users:
    - [tools](https://github.com/digital-earths-global-hackathon/tools) has scripts, environments, tutorials and other things for nodes and users
    - [hk25-teams](https://github.com/digital-earths-global-hackathon/hk25-teams) contains folders for each science teams
    - There are sample notebooks in the `examples` folder in [hk25-teams](https://github.com/digital-earths-global-hackathon/hk25-teams)
    - Several of the nodes have their own folders in [hk25-teams](https://github.com/digital-earths-global-hackathon/hk25-teams) with node-specific examples

- Discussions will happen asynchronously on github using github issues with labels for each science team (see discussion under science teams above)

## Zoom

- To maintain real-time coordination and discussions among nodes, we will host daily Zoom sessions.

- These sessions will allow teams to share progress, challenges, and feedback.
Key-note presentations and other relevant contributions can be recorded and collected in a multimedia space (TBD - Vimeo channel?)

- A link to the recurring Zoom meeting will be provided before the event:

- Each science team (see below) will have their own zoom breakout room (using the name of the science team).  

<!-- Each node should designate a representative to join the daily check-in call (determining fixed times to organize these check-ins). -->
